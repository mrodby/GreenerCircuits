        My background spans a wide variety of software development skills, from
        individual development to managing multiple teams, from individual
        device drivers to distributed cooperating programs, from assembly
        language to Ruby on Rails.

      <p>
        With my degrees in Electrical Engineering (BSEE) and Computer Science
        (MSCS), my sweet spot is in embedded software, especially where
        detailed knowledge of the hardware it runs on is required for good
        performance, optimal features, or both.

  <br/>My projects have included:
  <ul>
    <li>
      <a href='power.php'>Greener Circuits:</a> Python programs and PHP web
      pages that monitor the power used by each circuit of my house, keep
      track of that usage in a database, graphs usage over time, and notify
      me when something happens that I am interested in. Except for the actual
      monitoring device itself, all of the software (including the database
      and web server) runs in a Raspberry Pi Zero, a tiny $5 computer that
      runs Linux. You can see the results here, and the source code is
      available on GitHub here. I wrote all of the custom software for this
      project. The web pages are so simple that I didnâ€™t bother with a more
      powerful framework. If this were to turn into something real, I would
      start over in a real web framework, such as Ruby on Rails.<br/>

    <li>
      APMI Ballots: A C++/MFC Windows program to maintain a database of condo
      associations and condo owners to support annual meetings of those
      associations. This software interfaces directly with an optical ballot
      reader and does the unexpectedly complex calculations to tally votes
      that are weighted by percentage of ownership for each condo. I wrote all
      of the custom software for this project.
